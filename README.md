# InvestmentStrategyModel
This model/code focuses on distributing finance funds across manually shortlisted companies to give the best investment ratio for varying investor risk appetite. 
The model was created from scratch, and is user friendly. Any investor can enter the list of stocks in the model, and et voila! The machine spits out 6 different investment distributions, and investor can choose which to use, depending on his time scale perspective of the investment and risk behaviour.
